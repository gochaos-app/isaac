@Isaac: Check the running process in linux    

To check the running processes in Linux, you can use the "top" command. This command provides a real-time view of the running processes and their resource usage, such as CPU, memory, and disk I/O. You can also use the "ps" command to list the currently running processes. Additionally, you can use the "htop" command, which is a more advanced and interactive version of top.


@Isaac: sys.save
